This Portfolio contains one page that displays information about myself and a couple of my projects.  It uses HTML for the page structure, CSS and Bootstrap to style the page, and JavaScript and jQuery for interactivity.

## <a name="usage"></a>Usage

* The page should display three main sections in the body
    * The two project sections should both include working links to the project repositories and project deployed site
* The page should also contain a footer that includes links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, as well as a link to download my resume.
    * Clicking on the one of these three icons should bring up the links
    * Clicking the icons again should hide them
